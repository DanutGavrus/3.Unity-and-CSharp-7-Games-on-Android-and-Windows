## Getting Started
For each game you can find BOTH .apk and .rar versions of the game for EASY PLAYING. Also, code can be found in the C# Scripts folders where .cs files are.

### Installing
ANDROID VERSION ! For each game:
```
1) Download .apk version from "1. Android Version Installers";
2) Place it anywhere on your phone(If not already downloaded on the phone);
3) Tap the .apk and then tap the install button;
4) For step 3) your phone might warn you that "For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknows apps from this source.", but do not worry. This is because the app was not downloaded from Google Play Store, so:

4.2) Tap on "Allow from this source" in order to check it.
